## Introduction to WikipediaGeoCoder

WikipediaGeoCoder is a package designed to use Wikipedia to return the latitude and longitude coordinates of locations. Traditional geocoders are often unable to find the coordinates of historic locations - e.g. old mining towns that are now ghost towns. However,
this information is often available on wikipedia


## Example
```{r}
library(wikipediageocoder)
# location string that google geocoding returns NA
search_string = 'mare island navy yard'
page_name = search_for_wikipedia_page("mare island navy yard")
print(page_name)
coordinates = geocode_wikipedia_page(page_name)
print(coordinates)

```
